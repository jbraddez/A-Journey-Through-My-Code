      <h2>September 2022</h2>
      <p>After choosing Computer Science as a GCSE, I began coding in Python and was fascinated with how computers work and by programming you can make it do anything. Little to my knowledge, my journey with coding began here...</p>

      <h2>February 2023 - February 2024</h2>
      <p>After a while of coding in school, I coded projects constantly and did a 100 days of Python in Replit. I only completed around 70 days then I installed VScode for the first time. Project after project, I found my passion.</p>

      <h2>February 2024</h2>
      <p>I wanted to make games but I knew I wasn't experienced enough until I found PyGame. I watched one tutorial on flappy bird and this is where the realisation of how you can make anything you want with coding really hit me.</p>

      <h2>March - April 2024</h2>
      <p>After I made Flappy Bird, I made different themes for it such as a space theme. Then I made 3 other games, 2 of which I love so much to this day (although one has around 5000 lines - its not very optimised). I loved making these and realised I liked coding visual things which is where I finally moved on from Python.</p>

      <h2>March 2024</h2>
      <p>This is where I moved on from Python. I wanted to make apps, but after research into SwiftUI I decided to make websites first. I began learning HTML, CSS and JS. Looking back really shows you how far you have come. With experience with this I can eventually make money too...</p>

      <h2>June 2024</h2>
      <p>I've learnt so much about HTML, CSS and JavaScript from hours of tutorials to my own practice sites too. I even gained my first experience with an API inside a tutorial showing me how much can be done so simply. I made a mini portfolio to showcase the websites I've made and hosted with GitHub.</p>

      <h2>July 2024</h2>
      <p>It's my brother's birthday this month and I decided to make him a website for him as he is a music artist. I used all the skills I had gained and created an amazing looking website that also has made me abit of money (despite being a present) due to wanting more pages and everything added.</p>

      <h2>August 2024</h2>
      <p>Although I love making websites I wanted to try a different pathway with technology, but something I'm familiar with. I began basic hacking on Hack This Site and completed the Basic, Realstic and JavaScript challenges.</p>

      <h2>September 2024</h2>
      <p>I joined a Sixth Form College learning Maths, Computer Science and IT. I was still constantly creating websites after I realised hacking isn't my main passion. I began my first big project called Code Comrade, but in the end it was scrapped. One day I hope to come back to it.</p>

      <h2>November 2024</h2>
      <p>I came across a Game Off on itch.io and had always been fascinated by making games so I took this opportunity to learn Unity. Using my programming knowledge and C# from college, I picked it up quickly and made a game called Secrets of the Sanctuary that I had so much fun making, but game developing doesn't seem to be for me, I can't make assets and struggle for ideas.</p>

      <h2>December 2025</h2>
      <p>I updated my dad's website for his business to renew the information and add a calculator using php via an iframe. I had to host and manage his site, ensure all details are correct and make sure it works flawlessly. I gained more real-life experience so I'm reading for real clients. I also made a revision site becoming my second large project which helped me in my IT test.</p>

      <h2>Present Day (January 2025)</h2>
      <p>My journey through coding has taken me far. I've found my passion, I've learnt a vast amount of things within programming, web hosting, basic hacking and other things. I hope to carry on enjoying coding and eventually make it my career. I have a bingo card to finish this year (and you can make your own)! Thank you for reading my Journey Through Code.</p>
